			<h1>Our aim is to ensure that the views and thoughts of people 50+ are heard</h1>
			<q>We provide a means for individuals and groups to influence local and national government where decisions may impact on the everyday life of All pensioners
			We also have a role diseminating information with bi-monthly meetings on topical issues and a regular newsletter to all members, as well as “Forum Specials” such as our newly established “Financial Fair” events, with expert advice on hand, or the screening of “Sell Off” and Charity Trusteeship Seminars
			And – there is the fun side of things too, with a range of outings and events open to Forum Members – anything from guided tours of heritage houses, cinema outings, riverside walks or behind the scenes at a brewery!</q>
