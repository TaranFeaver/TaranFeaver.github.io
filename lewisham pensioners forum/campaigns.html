				</u>
			<h3><p style="float="left">
			We have achieved alot with the kind help of the individuals in lewisham. For example the on going fight in saving the services at Lewisham Hospital. The Hard working staff at Lewisham Hospital are undergoing alot right now espically considering there arent alot of people looking to go into that sector.Whilst this has been tough, it has brought alot of different groups together. Working with Important foundations such as Keep warm and Well and dying matters are also campaigns that we have promoted before. Its very important for awareness to be spread about these organistations. </p>
			In addition to this there has been a partnership with alot of local IT products and services that being used to help individuals ease into technology through the use of Tablets and computers.
			<h3><p style="color:#404040"> Often leading to the knowledge of cheaper services like Utility and shopping! </p>
